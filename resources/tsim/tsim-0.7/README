tsim v0.7-HUT (2005-08-01)

tsim is a simple train simulator usually used to practise concurrent
programming.

To compile tsim on Linux and Cygwin, run make in the main tsim directory (the
one containing the Makefile). On Solaris, Irix and FreeBSD, you must edit the
Makefile to contain the the right compiler flags by commenting the compiler
flags for Linux/Cygwin and uncommenting the flags for your chosen operating
system.

tsim has been tested on Linux, SunOS, Irix, FreeBSD and Cygwin on Windows XP.
tsim requires X11.

resources.c refers to bitmap and sound directories; you can change the default
directories for these by editing the two following lines:

#define BITMAPDIR "./bitmaps"
#define SOUNDDIR  "./sounds"

The colours used can be overridden using the X resources:

    tsim*foreground: white
    tsim*background: black

(or in fallback_resources in tsim.c).

You can use, modify and redistribute tsim to your liking. It would be nice if
you kept the credits for people who have contributed.
